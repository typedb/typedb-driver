/*
 * This file determines the order in which class modules are loaded at runtime.
 * Superclasses must always be loaded before their subclasses, otherwise an error will occur
 * whenever either class is instantiated at runtime.
 * NOTE: this does not apply to interfaces, which are erased at runtime.
 *
 * A good to way to find circular dependencies is to install `madge` and run it on the `dist` folder
 * containing the resulting `.js` files (can be forced with `npx tsc`).
 * Then reduce multi-hop circular dependencies one by one by pointing both circular dependents at each other via this file.
