## TypeDB Driver for Node.js: Integration Tests

These JavaScript tests verify the correctness of connection, Concept and Query methods.

The only prerequisite to run them locally is that you must have `npm` or `yarn` installed, and a TypeDB server running in the background.

To run all tests, run:
```
npm test
```
