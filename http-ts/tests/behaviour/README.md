## TypeDB Driver for Node.js: Behaviour Tests

To develop the tests, simply run:
```
tsc
```
- If the `tsc` command isn't found, install it using `npm install -g typescript`.
- If there are compiler errors, you may have a mismatched TypeScript version. Try `npm uninstall -g typescript; npm install -g typescript@{version}` where `{version}` is the version specified in root `package.json`.

Running `tsc` will create the `dist` directory on your local machine, where all the BDD step implementations import typedb-driver symbols from. This allows your IDE to provide IntelliSense.

> NOTE: When importing symbols in the test files, you must import everything from the 'dist' directory, or the tests will fail at runtime. This is because the Bazel test script compiles the driver's source files and puts them in a folder called 'dist'.

The tests are all invoked via Bazel test targets, as in Driver Java.
