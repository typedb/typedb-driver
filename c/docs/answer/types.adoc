[#_ConceptMap]
=== ConceptMap



Contains a mapping of variables to concepts.

[#_ConceptMapGroup]
=== ConceptMapGroup



Contains an element of the TypeQL Get Group query result.

[#_ConceptMapGroupIterator]
=== ConceptMapGroupIterator



Iterator over the ``ConceptMapGroup``s in the result of the TypeQL Get Group query.

[#_ConceptMapIterator]
=== ConceptMapIterator



Iterator over the ``ConceptMap``s in the result of a TypeQL Get query.

[#_Explainable]
=== Explainable



Contains an explainable object.

[#_Explainables]
=== Explainables



Contains explainable objects.

[#_Explanation]
=== Explanation



An explanation of which rule was used for inferring the explained concept, the condition of the rule, the conclusion of the rule, and the mapping of variables between the query and the ruleâ€™s conclusion.

[#_ExplanationIterator]

Iterator over the ``Explanation``s in the result of the explain query.

[#_StringIterator]
=== StringIterator



Iterator over the strings in the result of a request or a TypeQL Fetch query.

[#_StringPair]
=== StringPair



A ``StringPair`` used to represent the pair of variables involved in an ownership. ``_0`` and ``_1`` are the owner and attribute variables respectively.

[#_StringPairIterator]
=== StringPairIterator



Iterator over the ``StringPair``s representing explainable owner-attribute variable pairs

[#_StringPromise]
=== StringPromise



Promise object representing the result of an asynchronous operation. Use string_promise_resolve(StringPromise*) to wait for and retrieve the resulting string.

[#_ValueGroup]
=== ValueGroup



Contains an element of a TypeQL Get Group Aggregate query result.

[#_ValueGroupIterator]
=== ValueGroupIterator



Iterator over the ``ValueGroup``s in the result of the Get Group Aggregate query.

[#_VoidPromise]
=== VoidPromise



Promise object representing the result of an asynchronous operation. A VoidPromise does not return a value, but must be resolved using void_promise_resolve(VoidPromise*) to ensure the operation has completed, or for a failed operation to set the error.
