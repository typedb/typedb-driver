[#_enum_ConsistencyLevel]
=== ConsistencyLevel

Consistency levels of operations against a distributed server. All driver methods have default recommended values, however, readonly operations can be configured in order to potentially speed up the execution (introducing risks of stale data) or test a specific replica. This setting does not affect clusters with a single node.
