|Name |Type |Description
a| `include_instance_types` a| `bool \| None` a| If set, specifies if types should be included in instance structs returned in ConceptRow answers. This option allows reducing the amount of unnecessary data transmitted.
a| `prefetch_size` a| `int \| None` a| If set, specifies the number of extra query responses sent before the client side has to re-request more responses. Increasing this may increase performance for queries with a huge number of answers, as it can reduce the number of network round-trips at the cost of more resources on the server side. Minimal value: 1.
