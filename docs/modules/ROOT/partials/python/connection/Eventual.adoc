=== Eventual

*Package*: `typedb.api.connection.consistency_level.ConsistencyLevel`

Eventual consistency level. Allow stale reads from any replica and execution orchestration through a non-primary replica. Does not guarantee latest writes, but is eventually faster compared to other consistency levels. Note that the target replica can redirect the request, if needed.
