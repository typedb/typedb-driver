=== NamedRole

`class`

*Package*: `typedb.api.analyze.named_role`

‘links’ &amp; ‘relates’ constraints accept unscoped role names. Since an unscoped role-name does not uniquely identify a role-type, (Different role-types belonging to different relation types may share the same name) an internal variable is introduced to handle the ambiguity

// tag::methods[]
[#_NamedRole_name_]
===== method ``name``

[source,python]
----
name() -> str
----

The unscoped role name specified in the query.

[#_NamedRole_variable_]
===== method ``variable``

[source,python]

----

The internal variable injected to handle ambiguity in unscoped role names.

`Variable`
