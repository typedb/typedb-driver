[#_driver_close]
==== - driver_close

[source,cpp]
----
void driver_close(struct TypeDBDriver* driver)
----



Closes the driver. Before instantiating a new driver, the driver that’s currently open should first be closed. Closing a driver frees the underlying Rust object.

.Returns
`void`

[#_driver_force_close]
==== - driver_force_close

[source,cpp]
----
void driver_force_close(struct TypeDBDriver* driver)
----



Forcibly closes the driver. To be used in exceptional cases.

.Returns
`void`

[#_driver_is_open]
==== - driver_is_open

[source,cpp]
----
bool driver_is_open(const struct TypeDBDriver* driver)
----



Checks whether this connection is presently open.

.Returns
`bool`

[#_driver_open]
==== - driver_open

[source,cpp]
----
struct TypeDBDriver* driver_open(const char* address, const struct Credentials* credentials, const struct DriverOptions* driver_options)
----



Open a TypeDB C Driver to a TypeDB server available at the provided address.

[source,cpp]
----
struct TypeDBDriver* driver_open_with_description(const char* address, const struct Credentials* credentials, const struct DriverOptions* driver_options, const char* driver_lang)
----



Open a TypeDB Driver to a TypeDB server available at the provided address. This method allows driver language specification for drivers built on top of the native C layer.

[#_init_logging]
==== - init_logging

[source,cpp]
----
void init_logging(void)
----



Enables logging in the TypeDB driver.

This function sets up tracing with two environment variables:

 ``TYPEDB_DRIVER_LOG``: Fine-grained control using the same syntax as ``RUST_LOG``. Example: ``TYPEDB_DRIVER_LOG=typedb_driver=debug,typedb_driver_clib=trace``
 ``TYPEDB_DRIVER_LOG_LEVEL``: Simple log level that applies to both ``typedb_driver`` and ``typedb_driver_clib`` crates. Overrides any settings from ``TYPEDB_DRIVER_LOG``. Example: ``TYPEDB_DRIVER_LOG_LEVEL=debug``


If neither is set, the default level is INFO for driver crates.

The logging is initialized only once to prevent multiple initializations in applications that create multiple drivers.

`void`
