[#_Struct_VoidPromise]
==== class Struct VoidPromise



Promise object representing the result of an asynchronous operation. A VoidPromise does not return a value, but must be resolved using void_promise_resolve(VoidPromise*) to ensure the operation has completed, or for a failed operation to set the error.

[#_void_promise_resolve]
==== void_promise_resolve

[source,cpp]
----
void void_promise_resolve(struct VoidPromise* promise)
----



Waits for the operation represented by the ``VoidPromise`` to complete. In case the operation failed, the error flag will only be set when the promise is resolved. The native promise object is freed when it is resolved.
