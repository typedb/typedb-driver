[#_Struct_ConstraintExactness]
==== Struct ConstraintExactness

[source,cpp]
----
class
----



Tells apart exact variants of constraints from the ones allowing subtype-polymorphism. e.g. ``isa!`` would be represented as an ``Constraint::Isa`` with its exactness field ``ConstraintExactness::Exact``.

[#_Enum_ConstraintExactness]
==== Enum ConstraintExactness

[source,cpp]
----
class

Tells apart exact variants of constraints from the ones allowing subtype-polymorphism. e.g. ``isa!`` would be represented as an ``Constraint::Isa`` with its exactness field ``ConstraintExactness::Exact``.

 
  
   Enumerator
  
  
   Exact&nbsp;
   

Indicates the constraint matches exactly the specified type - e.g. ``isa!`` or ``sub!``
  
  
   Subtypes&nbsp;
   

Indicates the constraint matches the specified type and its subtypes - e.g. ``isa!`` or ``sub!``
