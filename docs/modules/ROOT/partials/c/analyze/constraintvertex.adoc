==== Struct ConstraintVertex

`rust struct (pointer)`



The answer to a TypeDB query is a set of concepts which satisfy the ``Constraints`` in the query. A ``ConstraintVertex`` is either a variable, or some identifier of the concept.

 A ``Variable`` is a vertex the query must match and return.
 A ``Label`` uniquely identifies a type
 A ``Value`` represents a primitive value literal in TypeDB.
 A ``NamedRole`` vertex is used in links &amp; relates constraints, as multiple relations may have roles with the same name. The types inferred for ``Variable``, ``Label`` and ``NamedRole`` vertices can be read from the ``variable_annotations`` field of the ``Conjunction`` it is in.


[#_constraint_vertex_as_label]
==== function ``constraint_vertex_as_label``

[source,c]
----
struct Concept* constraint_vertex_as_label(const struct ConstraintVertex* vertex)
----



Unwraps the ``ConstraintVertex`` instance as a Label. Will panic if the instance is not a Label variant.

[caption=""]
.Returns
`struct Concept*`

[#_constraint_vertex_as_named_role]
==== function ``constraint_vertex_as_named_role``

[source,c]
----
struct NamedRole* constraint_vertex_as_named_role(const struct ConstraintVertex* vertex)
----



Unwraps the ``ConstraintVertex`` instance as a NamedRole. 'links' &amp; 'relates' constraints accept unscoped role names. Since an unscoped role-name does not uniquely identify a role-type, (Different role-types belonging to different relation types may share the same name) an internal variable is introduced to handle the ambiguity Will panic if the instance is not a NamedRole variant.

[caption=""]
.Returns
`struct NamedRole*`

[#_constraint_vertex_as_value]
==== function ``constraint_vertex_as_value``

[source,c]
----
struct Concept* constraint_vertex_as_value(const struct ConstraintVertex* vertex)
----



Unwraps the ``ConstraintVertex`` instance as a Value. Will panic if the instance is not a Value variant.

[caption=""]
.Returns
`struct Concept*`

[#_constraint_vertex_as_variable]
==== function ``constraint_vertex_as_variable``

[source,c]
----
struct Variable* constraint_vertex_as_variable(const struct ConstraintVertex* vertex)
----



Unwraps the ``ConstraintVertex`` instance as a Variable. Will panic if the instance is not a Variable variant.

[caption=""]
.Returns
`struct Variable*`

[#_constraint_vertex_drop]
==== function ``constraint_vertex_drop``

[source,c]
----
void constraint_vertex_drop(struct ConstraintVertex* obj)
----



Frees the native rust ``ConstraintVertex`` object.

[caption=""]
.Returns
`void`

[#_constraint_vertex_variant]
==== function ``constraint_vertex_variant``

[source,c]
----
enum ConstraintVertexVariant constraint_vertex_variant(const struct ConstraintVertex* vertex)
----



Returns the variant of the constraint

[caption=""]
.Returns
`enum ConstraintVertexVariant`
